Pneumonia Detection with Model Uncertainty Estimation:

I have Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images.Along with I did Integrated Monte Carlo Dropout
for uncertainty estimation, enabling the identification of low-confidence predictions. 
After that I have Achieved high recall and F1 score (0.7692), Accuracy: 82.5% with a focus on minimizing false negatives. Also applied data augmentation and normalization to enhance model performance
